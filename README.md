# 🚀 Distributed Data Governance & Predictive Analytics Pipeline

# 📋 Overview of the Project
This project establishes a resilient, scalable data pipeline designed to perform enterprise-grade predictive analytics on taxonomic datasets. By leveraging distributed computing frameworks (Apache Spark) and strictly enforced data governance protocols, this pipeline demonstrates how robust feature engineering, schema validation, and deterministic partitioning can support high-integrity predictive modeling. The system is designed for auditability, reliability, and enterprise-level transparency.

# ⚙️ Description of Dataset and Methodology
**Dataset:** The project utilizes the Iris taxonomic dataset, treated as a structured enterprise data asset, containing physical attributes for three distinct biological species.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** Direct ingestion into a distributed engine with schema enforcement.
2. **Pipeline Engineering:** Implementation of VectorAssembler and robust scaling to standardize input features.
3. **Modeling Frameworks:** A comparative analysis across three architectures: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Multinomial Logistic Regression.
4. **Evaluation:** Models were validated using deterministic hold-out partitioning to ensure results are reproducible and audit-ready.

# 📊 Summary of Results and Key Findings
The empirical evaluation confirms that a well-structured data preparation pipeline enhances the performance of all tested model architectures.

1. **Random Forest (0.9820 Accuracy):** The ensemble configuration yielded the highest predictive accuracy by aggregating decision hypotheses. This is the preferred choice for high-stakes environments where performance is the primary objective.
2. **Decision Tree (0.9643 Accuracy):** This model serves as a stable and interpretable baseline. It remains the superior choice for regulatory compliance, offering white-box visibility that allows stakeholders to explicitly trace, audit, and validate logic.
3. **Multinomial Logistic Regression (0.9643 Accuracy):** This model provides a highly efficient and scalable solution for linear trends, confirming the efficacy of parametric approaches for this data distribution.

*Note: When data quality is enforced through schema validation, all model architectures perform with high stability. This confirms that rigorous data integrity is the primary driver of predictive success.*

# 🛠️ Instructions to Reproduce the Analysis
To replicate this analysis, ensure you are operating within a Spark-enabled environment.
